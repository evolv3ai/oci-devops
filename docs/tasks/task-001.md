# Task 001 (Revised): Restore November 2024 Working Configuration

## Executive Summary
We had a **fully working setup in November 2024** that was documented and cleaned up. However, RooCode's attempt to implement vibestack scripts has broken the authentication by switching from the proven config file method to variable-based authentication. We need to restore the working configuration.

## Historical Context

### November 2024: Working Setup ✅
- **Authentication**: Config file with `TF_VAR_oci_cli_config = /oci/config`
- **Docker Mount**: `~/.oci:/oci:ro`
- **Documentation**: Complete (900+ lines)
- **Repository**: Cleaned and organized
- **Status**: PRODUCTION READY

### September 2025: Current State ❌
- **Authentication**: Broken (switched to variables)
- **Environment**: Variables exist but are EMPTY
- **Repository**: Has new broken code
- **Status**: NOT WORKING

## Root Cause Analysis

The RooCode thread (`docs/threads/roo-thread-001.md`) attempted to implement vibestack infrastructure patterns but:
1. Changed authentication from config file to variables
2. Did not populate the variable values in Semaphore
3. Lost the working configuration that was established in November 2024

## Immediate Fix Required

### Step 1: Restore Config File Authentication

**File**: `terraform/main.tf` (line 12-24)

**Current (BROKEN)**:
```hcl
provider "oci" {
  tenancy_ocid     = var.tenancy_ocid
  user_ocid        = var.user_ocid
  fingerprint      = var.fingerprint
  private_key_path = var.private_key_path
  region           = var.region
}
```

**Replace with (WORKING)**:
```hcl
provider "oci" {
  config_file_profile = "DEFAULT"
}
```

### Step 2: Remove Unnecessary Variables

**File**: `terraform/variables.tf`

Remove these authentication variables (they don't work):
- `tenancy_ocid`
- `user_ocid`
- `fingerprint`
- `private_key_path`

Keep only:
- `compartment_id`
- `ssh_public_key`
- `region`
- Instance-related variables

### Step 3: Update Semaphore Environment

In Semaphore UI, the `oci-terra-vars` environment should have:
```
TF_VAR_oci_cli_config = /oci/config
TF_VAR_compartment_id = <ACTUAL_OCID>
TF_VAR_ssh_public_key = <ACTUAL_SSH_KEY>
TF_VAR_region = us-ashburn-1
```

**Note**: The compartment_id and ssh_public_key need ACTUAL values, not empty strings!

## Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Minimal Test
Use the `terraform/test-vcn-only.tf` I created to test just authentication:
```bash
terraform init
terraform plan -var="compartment_id=<OCID>"
terraform apply -auto-approve
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

### Phase 2: Full Infrastructure
Only after Phase 1 succeeds:
```bash
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## Files to Use

### From November 2024 Archive (WORKING):
- Review: `N:\Dropbox\06_AI\semaphore-ui\archive\CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md`
- Review: `N:\Dropbox\06_AI\semaphore-ui\archive\implementation-history\`

### Created Today (FIXES):
- `terraform/test-vcn-only.tf` - Minimal test
- `terraform/main-fixed.tf` - Restored config auth
- `terraform/variables-fixed.tf` - Cleaned variables
- `scripts/verify-setup.sh` - Validation script
- `ansible/test-connection.yml` - Ansible test

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Docker volume mounted: `~/.oci:/oci:ro`
- [ ] OCI config file exists at `~/.oci/config`
- [ ] Semaphore environment has ACTUAL values (not empty)
- [ ] Provider uses config file authentication
- [ ] Test VCN creates successfully
- [ ] Test VCN destroys successfully

## What NOT to Do

1. **DO NOT** use variable-based authentication
2. **DO NOT** create wrapper scripts (unnecessary)
3. **DO NOT** implement complex vibestack patterns before basics work
4. **DO NOT** leave environment variables empty

## Success Metrics

You'll know it's working when:
```
Task 21 output shows:
✅ Terraform initialized
✅ "Apply complete! Resources: 1 added"
✅ test_vcn_id = "ocid1.vcn.oc1.iad...."
✅ test_status = "SUCCESS - Authentication working!"
```

## Recovery Path

If still broken:
1. Copy exact configuration from November 2024 archive
2. Use the exact provider block that was working
3. Ensure Docker mount exists
4. Populate actual values in Semaphore

## Lesson Learned

**"If it ain't broke, don't fix it"**

The November 2024 setup was working perfectly. The attempt to implement more complex patterns broke the basic authentication. Always test incrementally and maintain working backups.

**Priority**: URGENT - System is currently broken
**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes to restore
**Risk**: LOW - We're reverting to proven configuration
