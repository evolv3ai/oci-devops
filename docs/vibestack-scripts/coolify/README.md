# Cloudflare Tunnel Setup for Coolify Self-Host

This directory contains the complete Cloudflare Tunnel automation solution for deploying and exposing your Coolify self-hosted instance securely through Cloudflare's network.

## üéØ Overview

This solution creates a secure tunnel from your Coolify server to Cloudflare, allowing access via `coolify.hdvfx.com` without opening inbound firewall ports. The tunnel provides:

- **Security**: No inbound ports needed on your server
- **Performance**: Cloudflare's global CDN acceleration
- **SSL/TLS**: Automatic certificate management
- **DDoS Protection**: Cloudflare's security features
- **IPv4/IPv6**: Dual-stack connectivity
- **Self-Hosting**: Complete control over your deployment platform

## üìã Detailed Process

### OCI Infrastructure Setup Process

The `oci-coolify-infrastructure-setup.sh` script performs the following steps:

1. **Environment Validation**
   - Validates all required OCI environment variables
   - Checks OCI CLI connectivity and authentication
   - Verifies SSH key file existence

2. **Compartment Creation**
   - Creates CoolifyLab compartment under tenancy
   - Isolates all Coolify resources for organization
   - Handles existing compartment gracefully

3. **Network Infrastructure**
   - Creates Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) with 10.0.0.0/16 CIDR
   - Creates public subnet with 10.0.1.0/24 CIDR
   - Sets up Internet Gateway for external connectivity
   - Configures default route table for internet access

4. **Security Configuration**
   - Creates custom security list for Coolify traffic

   - Handles IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack resolution

4. **Public Hostname Routes**
   - Configures tunnel routing for your domain
   - Sets up HTTP handling for Coolify web interface
   - Optimizes settings for web application traffic

5. **Deployment Preparation**
   - Generates all necessary configuration files

   - Provides deployment scripts and instructions

### Configuration Details

#### Tunnel Configuration (`config.yml`)
```yaml
tunnel: f76c76d4-620f-4ff1-8d60-743f0c008a39
credentials-file: /etc/cloudflared/f76c76d4-620f-4ff1-8d60-743f0c008a39.json

ingress:
  - hostname: coolify.hdvfx.com
    service: http://localhost:8000
    originRequest:
      connectTimeout: 30s
      tlsTimeout: 30s
      tcpKeepAlive: 30s
      keepAliveConnections: 10
      keepAliveTimeout: 90s
  - service: http_status:404
```

#### Key Features
- **HTTP Support**: Direct HTTP connection to Coolify (no TLS verification needed)
- **Optimized Timeouts**: Configured for web application requirements
- **Connection Pooling**: Maintains persistent connections for better performance
- **Fallback Handling**: 404 response for unmatched requests

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. DNS Resolution Problems
**Symptoms**: `DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN` or only IPv6 resolution

**Solution**: Run the DNS fix script
```bash
./coolify-fix-dns.sh
```

This ensures the CNAME record is properly proxied through Cloudflare.

#### 2. Tunnel Connection Issues
**Check tunnel status on server**:
```bash
sudo systemctl status cloudflared-coolify-tunnel
sudo journalctl -u cloudflared-coolify-tunnel -f
```

#### 3. Coolify Access Issues
**Verify Coolify is running**:
```bash
sudo docker ps | grep coolify
curl -I http://localhost:8000
```

#### 4. Coolify Not Starting
**Check Coolify logs**:
```bash
sudo docker logs coolify
sudo docker compose -f /data/coolify/source/docker-compose.yml logs
```

### DNS Verification
```bash
# Check DNS resolution
nslookup coolify.hdvfx.com
dig coolify.hdvfx.com

# Should return both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses when properly configured
```

### Tunnel Testing
```bash
# Test tunnel connectivity
curl -I https://coolify.hdvfx.com

# Should return Coolify web interface headers
```

### Coolify Service Management
```bash
# Check all Coolify containers
sudo docker ps | grep coolify

# Restart Coolify
sudo docker restart coolify

# Update Coolify
curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | bash
```
